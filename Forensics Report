1. Executive Summary
Incident Overview: One paragraph summary of what happened (e.g., unauthorized access, malware, insider threat).
Timeline: Key dates/times (discovery, escalation, response).
Impact Summary: What was affected? (Data, systems, people).
Conclusion: Brief mention of root cause and next steps.

2. Objectives and Scope
Goals:
Identify indicators of compromise (IOCs).
Understand attacker‚Äôs method and impact.
Preserve and document digital evidence.

Scope:
Devices, users, systems under investigation.
Time window covered by the investigation.
Any exclusions or assumptions.

3. Methodology
Use forensic best practices for evidence handling:
Acquisition:
Tools used (e.g., FTK Imager, dd, dcfldd).
Hashing evidence (MD5/SHA256) for integrity.

Preservation:
Chain of custody maintained.
Write-blockers used on physical media.

Analysis:
Disk, memory, logs, network traffic, registry, malware artifacts.

Reporting:
Document every step and finding.

4. Findings
Break this down into clear categories:
a) File System Analysis
Suspicious files, deleted files, hidden partitions.
Timestamps manipulation (MAC times).

b) Malware/Executable Analysis
Hashes, paths, compile times.
Obfuscation or persistence mechanisms.

c) Network Forensics
Suspicious connections (IP, port, protocol).
Data exfiltration evidence.
Use tools like Wireshark, Zeek, NetFlow.

d) Memory Forensics
Live malware, decrypted strings, credentials.
Tools: Volatility, Rekall.

e) Log Analysis
Windows Event Viewer, syslog, auth logs.
Logins, errors, privilege escalation.

f) User & Account Analysis
New accounts created, privilege misuse.
Correlation with timestamps and logs.

5. Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)
List:
Malicious IPs or domains
Hashes (MD5/SHA1/SHA256)
File paths or process names
Registry keys or command history

6. Impact Assessment
CIA Breakdown:
Confidentiality: Was sensitive data accessed?
Integrity: Were files or systems altered?
Availability: Was service disrupted?

7. Conclusions
Root Cause: How the breach happened.
Attacker Goal: Financial gain, data theft, insider revenge, etc.
Persistence/Backdoors: Still active or not?

8. Recommendations
Short-term: Patch, isolate, reset passwords.
Long-term: Monitoring, training, policy changes.
Suggestions for better hardening (Defense in Depth, Least Privilege).
