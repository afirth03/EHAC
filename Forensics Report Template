1. Executive Summary
Incident Overview: One paragraph summary of what happened (e.g., unauthorized access, malware, insider threat).
Timeline: Key dates/times (discovery, escalation, response).
Impact Summary: What was affected? (Data, systems, people).
Conclusion: Brief mention of root cause and next steps.

2. Objectives and Scope
Goals:
Identify indicators of compromise (IOCs).
Understand attacker’s method and impact.
Preserve and document digital evidence.

Scope:
Devices, users, systems under investigation.
Time window covered by the investigation.
Any exclusions or assumptions.

3. Methodology
Use forensic best practices for evidence handling:
Acquisition:
Tools used (e.g., FTK Imager, dd, dcfldd).
Hashing evidence (MD5/SHA256) for integrity.

Preservation:
Chain of custody maintained.
Write-blockers used on physical media.

Analysis:
Disk, memory, logs, network traffic, registry, malware artifacts.

Reporting:
Document every step and finding.

4. Findings
Break this down into clear categories:
a) File System Analysis
Suspicious files, deleted files, hidden partitions.
Timestamps manipulation (MAC times).

b) Malware/Executable Analysis
Hashes, paths, compile times.
Obfuscation or persistence mechanisms.

c) Network Forensics
Suspicious connections (IP, port, protocol).
Data exfiltration evidence.
Use tools like Wireshark, Zeek, NetFlow.

d) Memory Forensics
Live malware, decrypted strings, credentials.
Tools: Volatility, Rekall.

e) Log Analysis
Windows Event Viewer, syslog, auth logs.
Logins, errors, privilege escalation.

f) User & Account Analysis
New accounts created, privilege misuse.
Correlation with timestamps and logs.

5. Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)
List:
Malicious IPs or domains
Hashes (MD5/SHA1/SHA256)
File paths or process names
Registry keys or command history

6. Impact Assessment
CIA Breakdown:
Confidentiality: Was sensitive data accessed?
Integrity: Were files or systems altered?
Availability: Was service disrupted?

7. Conclusions
Root Cause: How the breach happened.
Attacker Goal: Financial gain, data theft, insider revenge, etc.
Persistence/Backdoors: Still active or not?

8. Recommendations
Short-term: Patch, isolate, reset passwords.
Long-term: Monitoring, training, policy changes.
Suggestions for better hardening (Defense in Depth, Least Privilege).

9. Appendices
Hash logs and verification
Tool outputs (Wireshark, Volatility, sha256sum, etc.)
Screenshots of artifacts
Full list of artifacts analyzed

Tools to Mention
dd / dcfldd – Disk imaging
sha256sum – Hashing evidence
Volatility – Memory analysis
Wireshark – Network capture
FTK Imager / Autopsy – GUI-based analysis
strings, hexdump, grep, file – Low-level investigation

                                                                Phases of Forensic Investigation (ISO/IEC 27037-43)
Identify: Locate potential digital evidence (PDE).

Collect: Take control of the device (physical seizure).

Acquire: Create forensic (bitwise) copies without altering original data.

Preserve: Maintain integrity using hashes and chain of custody.

Analyze: Examine for relevant artifacts.

Interpret: Deduce meaning, timelines, and context.

Report: Document findings in a structured, reproducible manner.

ACPO Principles (UK-based Best Practice)
Principle 1: Do not alter data on original media.

Principle 2: If alteration is necessary, document and justify it.

Principle 3: Maintain a full audit trail (chain of custody).

Principle 4: Investigative lead is accountable for adherence.

File System & Metadata Analysis
File system knowledge is critical (FAT, NTFS, etc.)

Tools inspect deleted files, slack space, alternate data streams, and prefetch/cache.

Recycle Bin Forensics: NTFS stores deleted files as $I (metadata) and $R (data) files.

Timestamps: Track Created, Modified, Accessed times (CMA) with caveats (e.g., timezone issues).

Data Recovery & Evidence
Unallocated Space: Files may be recoverable even after deletion.

MRUs, lnk Files, Registry Entries: Track recent activity, software usage, and connected devices.

Windows Registry: A goldmine for system and user-level forensic artifacts.

Triage & Planning
Triage: Quickly evaluate evidence sources (e.g., known bad file hashes).

Planning: SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures) are crucial.

Plans should evolve and tie to an asset register for forensic readiness.
Do not alter original evidence.
Respect data protection laws (e.g., GDPR).
Document every step and decision.
